# TensorFlow-course-final-scripts
This repository contains all the final assignments for each ML course I completed during my TensorFlow course from DeepLearning.AI. 
1. Handling complex images - classification of happy or sad emojis using a convulutional neural network.
2. Multi-class classification - interpreting the sign language MNIST dataset using a convulutional neural network.
3. NLP prediction - using a dataset of Shakespear's sonnets, predicting the next word in a sentence
4. Time-series prediction - using real world temperature data and predicting future temperatures using LSTMs.
